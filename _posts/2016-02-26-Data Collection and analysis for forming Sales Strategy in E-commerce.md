This article presents insights into problems faced by companies in getting competitive information from e-commerce channels and what they can do in such a scenario.

**Data Collection and Analysis for forming Sales Strategy in E-commerce**

Ecommerce in India is expected to be around USD 22 billion in 2015 with around 243 million in 2014. Internet penetration is only 19% and is expected to grow significantly in coming years.

Given these facts, companies have started forming strategies to become part of e-commerce growth. As part of same, they primarily need to look into the following areas:

-	Channels to sell on (like Amazon, Big basket, Peppertap etc)
-	Pricing
-	Marketing and promotions
-	Complementing existing channels rather than cannibalizing existing channels
-	Order fulfillment
-	Content Management (Ensuring right content on each channel for every product)
-	Competition analysis (Keeping an eye for new one too!!)

In traditional method of selling, companies relied on data from their market research efforts and external partners to form relevant strategies.

-	Market share divided based on
    - Volume
	-	Value
	-	Geography
	-	SKU’s wise (like say share in 1 KG pouch versus 25 gram pouch for one time use)
-	Market forecast
-	Competition analysis
	-	Pricing
	-	Geographical reach
	
With emergence of e-commerce, market share would not be available unless your e-commerce partner agrees to share it with you.

So, in this scenario, companies need to look into new parameters, customized for online marketplaces:

-	Most popular channels for concerned product
-	Market trackers
	-	Price comparison
	-	Promotions run by competition
	-	Data on bestsellers in relevant product category
	-	Top ranked products
	-	Own’s and competition’s share of 1st page
	-	New launches
-	Search optimization
-	ROI from promotions
-	Customer ratings of product
