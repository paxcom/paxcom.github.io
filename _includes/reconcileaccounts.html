      <h3>Reconcile accounts for due payments from E-marketplaces</h3>
      
      <p>Oh! This for sure is every seller's pain point. Marketplaces always tend to charge you incorrect commissions or logistics cost. Online sellers face other major issues like delayed payment cycles from the marketplaces, shipping costs on refunds  and cost of logistics on free delivery. Many sellers still do manual payment management which is highly prone to errors. </p>
      
      <p>We help you automatically reconcile the payable and receivables across multiple marketplaces. We offer account reconciliation for major Indian marketplaces like Flipkart, Amazon, Snapdeal, Paytm.</p>
