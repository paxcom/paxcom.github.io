      <h3>Manage order returns and cancellations</h3>
      
      <p>One challenge with e-Commerce is that if a number of orders is huge, so is the number of returns. Many online buyers purchase products on impulse decision, and by the time they received the product at their home they have changed their minds and make use of favorable return policies. <em><strong>Studies suggest that by 2020 ECommerce in India would have 10%-15% return rate.</strong></em> Are you managing your returns efficiently on time?? </p>
      
      <p>Online returns management also involves matching your inventory and account reconciliation from marketplaces for due payments. We offer a centralized panel to manage the returned orders for all sales channels. Sellers can also raise disputes to marketplaces in the case of bad inventory return from customers.</p>
