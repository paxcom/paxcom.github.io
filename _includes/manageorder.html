                	<p>One challenge with eCommerce is that if number of orders is huge, so is the number of returns. Online returns management also involves matching your inventory and account reconciliation from marketplaces for due payments.
We offer a centralized panel to manage the returned orders for all sales channels.
Studies suggest that by 2020 E-Commerce in India would have 10%-15% return rate. 
Are you managing your return efficiently on time??
