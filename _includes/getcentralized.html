            <h3>Get a centralized Orders view for all marketplaces</h3>
            
            <p>Managing orders for multiple channels is a challenging exercise. Several times, a day seller has to login seller panel for different accounts to collect the order from multiple marketplaces. Logistics management for many orders is another major issue for sellers who are on multiple channels. Too many orders also create problems and failing to manage orders might damage sellers or brand reputation.</p>
            
            <p>Paxcom integrates with high traffic online marketplaces Flipkart, Amazon, Paytm, and Snapdeal.  All your orders from marketplaces are fetched to a single panel, so no need to spend time and labor cost on reviewing seller panel every time.</p>
