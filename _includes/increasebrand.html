                    <h3>Increase your Brand visibility by Search Optimization</h3>
                    <p>Say you are selling “<strong>Your Brand Mango Juice</strong>” but an Amazon search of “<strong>Mango Drinks</strong>”
                      does not result in your product on its first page, then you are for sure losing some sales.
                      It is not only Google search engine optimization, you can optimize your content for marketplaces 
                      as well. A Bloomberg report says 44% of consumers use Amazon as a first option to research 
                      the product they intend to buy. </p>
