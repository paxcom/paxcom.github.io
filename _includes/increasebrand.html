      <h3>Increase your Brand visibility by Search Optimization</h3>
      <p>Content is the foremost weapon for an E-tailer to lead among its competitors. Buyer always searches the query using some relevant keywords and if end customers can get answers to all their questions from reading the product content, you are likely to close a sale. And obviously, if the content is nicely framed with good product images or videos, the ‘Wow’ factor works very well.</p>
      
      <p>Say you are selling <strong>“Your Brand Mango Juice”</strong> but an Amazon search of <strong>“Mango Drinks”</strong> does not result in your product on its first page, then you are for sure losing some sales.It is not only Google search engine optimization, you can optimize your content for marketplaces as well.</p>
      
      <p><em>A <strong>Bloomberg</strong> report states “44% of consumers use Amazon as a first option to research the product they intend to buy.”</em> <strong>Are your products visible on relevant keyword searches????</strong> Relevant keywords for your products can increase your sales rank,impact search results on online marketplaces and would influence your sales.</p>
