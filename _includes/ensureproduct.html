            <h3>Ensure Product data Compliance, Optimization and Consistency</h3>
            <p>If end customers can get answers to all their questions from reading the product content, you 
              are likely to close a sale. And obviously if the content is nicely framed with good product images 
              or videos, the ‘Aww’ factor works very well.</p>
            <p>To avoid confusing your customers and hence loosing a sale, your product information should
              be consistent across all channels and comply to your brand guidelines. Especially for products 
              with huge competition, sales can be impacted by content.</p>
